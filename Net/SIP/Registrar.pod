Net::SIP::Registrar - Endpoint for registering SIP clients

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $reg = Net::SIP::Registrar->new(
	dispatcher => $dispatcher,
	min_expires => 10,
	max_expires => 60,
	domains => [ 'example.com','example.org' ],
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package implements a simple SIP registrar. In the current implementation
registry information are only kept in memory, e.g. they are not preserved over
restarts.

The implementation itself does not checking if the UAC is authorized to 
register the given address. This can be done with using an appropriate 
Authorize Module inside a ReceiveChain in front of the registrar.

=over 8

=item dispatcher

L<Net::SIP::Dispatcher> object manging the registar. Mandatory.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item receive ( PACKET,LEG,FROM )

PACKET is the incoming packet,
LEG is the L<Net::SIP::Leg> where the packet arrived and FROM
is the C<< "ip:port" >> of the sender. Responses will be send
back to the sender through the same leg.

Called from the managing L<Net::SIP::Dispatcher> object if a new
packet arrives. Will return C<()> and ignore the packet if it's
not a REGISTER request or if it is not responsable for the domain
given in the C<From> heeader of the REGISTER request.

If it is responsable for the packet it will create a response
and return the code of the response. Responses are either
C<< 423 Interval too brief >> if the request expires time
is too small, or C<< 200 Ok >> if the expires time is 0 (e.g. the
client should be unregistered) or greater or equal B<min_expires>.

In case of a successful response it wil also update the internal
registry information.

=item query ( ADDR )

Search for ADDR (which has format C<< proto:user@domain >>)
in the registry. Returns @List of all sip or sips contacts
for ADDR.

=item expire

Removes all expired entries from the internal registry.
Called whenever the registry information gets updated from
sub B<receive>.
